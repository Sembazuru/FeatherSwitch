# FeatherSwitch
AdaFruit Feather Enable Switch Board. Designed in <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCAD.</a>

This board connects the GND pin and the EN pin (opposite sides of the Feather boards) together with a switch,
ideally across the underside of the Feather board. The switch is next to the battery connector.
It doesn't obscure the battery connector, but does make it more difficult to remove the battery.
This can be ameliorated by mounting this board to either a Feather Wing, or the Feather Doubler (or Tripler)
This allows conveniently turning off the board without disconnecting either a battery or the USB cable.
This first version of the board has hole size and spacing for AdaFruit#<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/805">805</a> slide switch or mechanical equivalent.
Note: The holes are slightly too small for 0.25"sq header pins.

The design works best if the 2oz copper option is selected to get 0.8mm (1/32", or half standard) thick boards. These boards are available to order using the button below.</br>
